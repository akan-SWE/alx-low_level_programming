**9-fizz_buzz.c**
The _"Fizz-Buzz test"_ is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of
programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.<br>

This program prints the numbers from _1_ to _100_, followed by a new line. But for multiples
of three print _Fizz_ instead of the number and for the multiples of five print _Buzz_<br>
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print _FizzBuzz_.<br>
